#Design of LQR and LQG Controller for an inverted dual-pendulum crane

## Overview

This MATLAB code simulates the control of a inverted dual-pendulum on a crane using LQR and LQG Controllers, and checks for the system's controllability and observability.

## Files

1. C_control.mlx: MATLAB script to check for controllability conditions.

2. D_lqr_linear.mlx: LQR controller for linearized system.

3. D_lqr_nonlinear.mlx: LQR controller for nonlinear system.

4. E_observability.mlx: Matlab script to check for observability, and luenberger observer for linearized system.

5. F_luenberger_nonlinear.mlx: Luenberger observer for nonlinear system.

6. G_lqg_linear.mlx: LQG for linear systems.

7. G_lqg_nonlinear.mlx: LQG for nonlinear systems.

## Prerequisites
Install Symbolic Math Toolbox.

## Usage
